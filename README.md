# Khalsa Governance Protocol

The **Khalsa Governance Protocol (KGP)** is a decentralised, identity-aware governance and seva (charity) coordination system for the global Sikh Panth. It does not replace Gurdwaras or Sikh institutions. Instead, it provides **neutral, transparent, cryptographically verifiable infrastructure** that institutions and Sangat may adopt voluntarily.

KGP delivers:

- **Khalsa ID (SBT):** Verified Sikh identity (non-transferable).  
- **Role SBTs:** Committee roles, maintainers, issuers, membership, and permissions.  
- **KHL Token:** Non-transferable governance access token (fixed price, buy-only).  
- **Seva Treasury Safe:** Transparent custody of seva funds.  
- **Snapshot Governance (v1):** Identity-gated voting.  
- **MACI Governance (v2):** Zero-knowledge, anti-collusion voting.  
- **Provenance Layer:** Event-based audit trails across identity, governance, and treasury.

KGP aligns with Sikh ethics: *Sarbat da Bhala* (universal welfare), *Seva* (selfless service), *Sat* (truth), *Nimrata* (humility), and collective decision making.
