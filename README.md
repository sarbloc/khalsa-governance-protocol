# Khalsa Governance Protocol

The **Khalsa Governance Protocol (KGP)** is a decentralised governance and seva (charitable) coordination framework for the global Sikh Panth. KGP does not replace Gurdwaras, committees, or Sikh institutions. Instead, it delivers **neutral, transparent, cryptographically sound tools** that Sikh bodies can use when they choose.

KGP provides:

- **Khalsa ID (SBT):** Verified Sikh identity
- **KHL Token:** Non-transferable governance access token
- **Seva Treasury:** Multisig-controlled seva funds
- **Snapshot → ZK-MACI:** Staged governance evolution
- **Ethereum + Arbitrum security:** Transparent, verifiable decision systems

Its purpose is to align Sikh governance with Sikh ethics: *Sarbat da Bhala* (Universal Welfare), *Seva* (Selfless Service), truth, fairness, humility, and collective decision making.
